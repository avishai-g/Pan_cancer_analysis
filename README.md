# Overview
* MP_distribution.R depicts the meta-program distribution of a certain cell type within individual samples and across the whole study. It requires a list of scRNAseq expression matrices of different samples in a study (of a certain cell type).  
* MP_list.RDS is a list of meta-programs for each cell type required for inferring the distributions in MP_distribution.R 
* heatCols.RDS is the colormap used for plotting heatmaps in MP_distribution.R
